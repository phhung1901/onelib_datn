            Only badly designed bonuses create a focus on the short term. But with ‘clawbacks’or bonuses paid
            based on long-term performance of an investment, executives are encouraged to look into the future.
            This is particularly so where co mpensation is in the form of shares, as then personal wealth is
            directly linked to the company’s value. It is a caricature to paint developing countries as lacking
            education systems; most do, and progress is rapid. Between 2000 and 2008, the enrolment rate in
            primary education globally rose from 80.

            This debate will inevitably tend to focus on bankers,because their bonuses tend to cause such uproar
            in the
            media, but bonuses are also a very common way of remunerating all sorts of executives. Many states
            have
            taken
            steps to limit bonuses, both in state-owned banks (especially the UK) and private sector ones too
            (e.g.
            Switzerland). Bonuses can come in cash or shares; the latter can be less desirable to CEOs
            especially, as
            they
            are often prevented from selling them for a limited period. Inevitably, steps might be taken to
            evade such
            limits
            providing authoritative advice on debating technique, the book covers the rules, structure and type
            of
            debate,
            offering tips on how to become a successful speaker. It is a key read for debaters at any level.
